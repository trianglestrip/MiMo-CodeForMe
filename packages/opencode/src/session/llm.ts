 * Lead-in for the orchestrator's fleet roster, and the reason the roster carries

 *
 * It used to be pushed as `<active-sessions>\n…\n</active-sessions>`, and users
 * saw that literal tag — rows and all — in the TUI. The TUI is not at fault: the
 * roster goes into the SYSTEM array and the TUI never renders system content.
 * The model was quoting it. It had every reason to: `orchestrator.txt` named the
 * tag five times and told it to "Look at `<active-sessions>`", so the tag was
 * vocabulary the prompt had taught it, and the literal string was sitting in its
 * context to copy.
 *
 * Asking it not to echo the tag would be another prompt instruction, and this PR
 * measured what those are worth — the maintainer/author paragraph lost 3/3 live
 * turns. So remove the artifact instead of requesting restraint: with no
 * `<active-sessions>` string anywhere in the assembled request, echoing it is not
 * a behaviour the model can exhibit. The prompt now refers to the roster
 * functionally ("your fleet roster") and keeps the field layout, which is the
 * part that was actually load-bearing for routing.
 *
 * Dropping the delimiter costs nothing structurally: this was the ONLY tagged
 * block in the system array (the agent prompt and the memory instructions are
 * both plain prose), and `dispatchLedgerNotice` already ships the same roster to
 * the model in a tool result with a prose header and no envelope.
 *
 * The "internal working context" sentence is a genuinely weaker lever than the
 * removal — it can only ask. It is here because it costs one line and it sits
 * ADJACENT to the data it governs rather than in a paragraph assembled far away.
 * It does not stop the model paraphrasing a child's title, and it is not claimed
 * to; what is mechanically closed is the literal tag.

- If you recommend one option, list it first and add "(Recommended)" at the end of its label.
- Set \`multiple: true\` when more than one option may apply; \`custom\` is on by default so the user can type their own answer — do not add an "Other" catch-all option.
